## Subject: Additional Information for SES Production Access Request

Dear AWS Support Team,

Thank you for reviewing my production access request for Amazon SES. I'm happy to provide additional details about my email forwarding implementation.

### Use Case Overview

I operate a **custom domain email forwarding service** for polarisaistudio.com using AWS SES receipt rules with Lambda. This is a **personal domain** where I receive business correspondence and forward it to my personal email account.

### Email Flow Architecture

**Receiving:**
- MX records direct incoming mail to SES (us-west-2)
- Email addresses: info@, support@, contact@, admin@polarisaistudio.com
- SES receipt rule stores email in S3 and triggers Lambda

**Forwarding:**
- Lambda retrieves email from S3
- Modifies headers to preserve sender information
- Forwards to verified personal email: polarisaistudio@gmail.com
- All forwarded emails are legitimate correspondence addressed to my domain

### Sender Verification & Consent

**Why recipients are verified:**
- All emails forwarded are sent **TO** my domain by external parties
- I (the domain owner) am the recipient, not the sender
- External senders have explicitly chosen to contact my business addresses
- I maintain full control over which addresses receive forwarded emails

**Bounce and Complaint Handling:**
- SES automatically handles bounces and complaints through configuration
- S3 lifecycle policy removes processed emails after 1 day
- CloudWatch logs track all forwarding operations
- Lambda includes error handling for failed deliveries

### Volume and Quality Metrics

**Expected Volume:**
- **Current:** 10-20 legitimate business emails per month
- **Peak:** Estimated 50-100 emails per month maximum
- **Type:** 100% transactional correspondence (inquiries, support requests, business communication)
- **No marketing emails:** This is purely for receiving and forwarding correspondence

**Quality Assurance:**
- All emails are wanted correspondence sent to my domain
- No bulk sending or marketing campaigns
- Recipients (me) have explicitly configured forwarding
- Domain is fully verified with SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records

### Infrastructure Details

**Domain Verification:**
- Domain: polarisaistudio.com
- DNS: Managed via AWS Route 53
- Verification: Domain identity verified in SES
- DKIM: Configured with 3 DKIM tokens
- SPF: Configured to authorize SES sending
- DMARC: Policy configured for alignment

**Technical Implementation:**
- Infrastructure as Code: Terraform-managed
- Lambda Runtime: Go (provided.al2023, ARM64)
- Region: us-west-2
- S3 Storage: 1-day retention with lifecycle policy
- Monitoring: CloudWatch Logs for all operations

### Compliance and Best Practices

**Email Best Practices:**
- ✅ Domain verified before requesting production access
- ✅ DKIM authentication configured
- ✅ SPF records properly configured
- ✅ DMARC policy implemented
- ✅ Bounce/complaint handling via SES
- ✅ Secure infrastructure (IAM roles, S3 encryption)

**Recipient Consent:**
- I am the sole recipient of forwarded emails
- All emails are addressed to my verified domain
- External senders voluntarily contact my business addresses
- No unsolicited email is generated by this system

### Production Access Benefits Needed

**Current Sandbox Limitations:**
- ✅ Can receive unlimited emails via SES receipt rules
- ❌ Can only forward to verified email addresses (my personal email is verified)
- ❌ Cannot preserve Reply-To headers with unverified senders
- ❌ Limited to 200 forwarded emails per day

**Production Access Requirements:**
- Enable Reply-To header preservation for natural reply workflow
- Remove restriction on sender addresses in forwarded emails
- Support higher volume if business grows beyond 200 emails/month
- Professional email forwarding without sandbox limitations

### Why This Request Should Be Approved

1. **Legitimate Use Case:** Personal business domain email forwarding
2. **Low Volume:** 50-100 emails/month, well below SES limits
3. **No Spam Risk:** Only forwarding received correspondence, not generating outbound campaigns
4. **Proper Configuration:** Domain verified, DKIM/SPF/DMARC configured
5. **Bounce Handling:** Automatic via SES configuration
6. **Monitored Infrastructure:** CloudWatch logging, Terraform-managed
7. **Best Practices:** Domain verified before requesting access (as recommended)

### Use Case Clarification

**What I'm NOT doing:**
- ❌ Sending marketing emails
- ❌ Bulk email campaigns
- ❌ Email to purchased/scraped lists
- ❌ Unsolicited email generation

**What I AM doing:**
- ✅ Receiving legitimate business emails at my domain
- ✅ Forwarding them to my personal email account
- ✅ Preserving sender information for proper replies
- ✅ Maintaining professional domain presence

### Technical Questions Answered

**Q: How do you handle bounces?**
A: SES automatic bounce handling is enabled. Lambda logs failed deliveries. S3 lifecycle removes processed emails after 1 day.

**Q: How do you handle complaints?**
A: Since all forwarded emails are wanted correspondence sent TO my domain, complaints are not expected. SES complaint handling is configured if they occur.

**Q: How do you ensure email quality?**
A: All emails are legitimate correspondence addressed to my verified domain. No bulk sending or generated emails.

**Q: What is your sending pattern?**
A: Low, irregular volume (10-100 emails/month) based on inbound correspondence received. No scheduled campaigns or bulk sends.

### Supporting Evidence

**Domain Ownership:**
- Verified domain identity: polarisaistudio.com
- DNS managed in Route 53 (same AWS account)
- GitHub Pages website: https://polarisaistudio.github.io

**Infrastructure Transparency:**
- Open-source Terraform configuration
- CloudWatch logs available for review
- S3 bucket policies restrict access appropriately
- Lambda function uses least-privilege IAM roles

### Request Summary

I respectfully request production access for my AWS SES account to support legitimate email forwarding for my personal business domain. This is a low-volume, high-quality use case with proper infrastructure, monitoring, and compliance measures in place.

**Key Points:**
- Personal business domain (polarisaistudio.com)
- Email forwarding only (receive and forward)
- Low volume (50-100 emails/month)
- Proper DNS configuration (verified domain, DKIM, SPF, DMARC)
- Bounce/complaint handling configured
- No marketing or bulk email
- Infrastructure monitored and logged

I'm happy to provide any additional information needed to approve this request.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,
